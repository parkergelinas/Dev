# Basic Hello World Notes

## New Line

> std::cout << "Hello\n";
> std::cout << "Hello again\n";
>
> > The escape sequence \n (backward slash and the letter n) generates a new line in a text string.

## Program Structure

- The first line instructs the compiler to locate the file that contains a library called iostream. This library contains code that allows for input and output.
- The main() function houses all the instructions for the program.

  > int main() {

  > std::cout << "1\n";

  > std::cout << "2\n";

  > std::cout << "3\n";

  > }
