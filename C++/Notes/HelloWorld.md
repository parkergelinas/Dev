# Basic Hello World Notes

I'm learning how to do this shit so relax if I fuck shit up ğŸ˜‹

## New Line

> std::cout << "Hello\n";
> std::cout << "Hello again\n";
>
> > The escape sequence \n (backward slash and the letter n) generates a new line in a text string.

## Program Structure

- The first line instructs the compiler to locate the file that contains a library called iostream. This library contains code that allows for input and output.
- The main() function houses all the instructions for the program.

> int main() {
> std::cout << "1\n"; std::cout << "2\n"; std::cout << "3\n";
> }
